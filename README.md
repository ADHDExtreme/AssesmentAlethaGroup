The assessment was written in node.js (I am using some modern es6+ JavaScript, I am running node 14, but I think it will still run on node 10+).

I use one non-node.js dependency and that is split. So before we start within the root where the package.json file is located you need to run "npm install" once the package is installed you can proceed to the problems.

Problem 1 Each problem folder has an index.js file. To run it, run "node index.js" in the terminal within the root of the problem-1 folder to start the project.The node standard input will start and ask you to enter states delimited by commas. When submitting the input you will receive both the JSON object and the SQL query in the terminal.When updating the csv files make sure to keep the filenames the same.

Problem 2 Each problem folder has an index.js file. To run it, run "node index.js" in the terminal within the root of the problem-2 folder to start the project.I did not opt to use standard input for this problem. So to update the coordinates go into the index folder and update the invocation of the getAreaOfIntersecRec() function. The invocation is at the bottom of the index.js file. There are multiple invocations of the function, feel free to run multiple or remove some.
